npm init, so dependencies are installable
express mongoose passport passport-jwt jsonwebtoken body-parser bcryptjs validator  ..
$ npm i -D nodemon as Dev dependencies, with it no need to restart server after every change
server after created in localhost:5000

in package.json under scripts are the start commands for the server.js SO RUNING FROM THE CONSOLE WE CAN ACCESS MORE WAYS TO START SERVER.js IN DIFFERENT WAYS
npm start = classic way, npm run server     starts the nodemon way, changes ares shown after saving

FOR NOT HAVE THE ROUTES ON SERVER.js , a folder with routes has all that
config has the keys, -- for mongo etc...

users.js has to do with autentication , profile all stuff in the site.
.. the routes are used in the server.js   ROUTES ARE MANAGIG THE JSON 

USING EXPRESS routers to us more files one for each resources, (users, posts ,profile)

//THE PORPOSE OF THE BACKEND  AND ROUTES::: IS SERVING JSON TO PICK FROM TEH FRONTEND

//@route GET api/users
//@description Get all
//@access Public

in my case is necessary to write those comments for authentication problems

if the access is private for example for people logged in
they need a jsonwebtoken to use to log in
